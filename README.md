# 30-Day-Readmission-Analysis
A Healthcare Data Science project analyzing the health outcome of (30-Day readmission) and the predictors associated.

## Overview

This project provides tools and methods for:
- Descriptive statistics and data visualization
- Risk and rate calculations
- Statistical inference and hypothesis testing
- Multivariable analysis
- Bias and confounding assessment

## Key Features

### 1. Data Description
- Variable classification (dichotomous, categorical, ordinal, continuous)
- Summary statistics computation
- Graphical display selection and creation

### 2. Risk Analysis
- Prevalence calculation
- Incidence rate computation
- Ratio comparisons between groups

### 3. Statistical Testing
- Normal distribution analysis
- Confidence interval calculation
- Hypothesis testing frameworks
- Test selection based on data types

### 4. Advanced Analysis
- Multivariable linear regression
- Logistic regression
- Survival analysis
- Confounding control methods

## Project Goals

1. **Accuracy**: Ensure correct variable classification and appropriate statistical technique selection
2. **Comprehensive Measurement**: Utilize various metrics (counts, proportions, risks, rates) for complete analysis
3. **Uncertainty Management**: Account for sampling variability in statistical inference
4. **Confounding Control**: Implement methods to isolate true effects of risk factors
5. **Contextual Interpretation**: Balance statistical and practical significance in results analysis

## Best Practices

- Select appropriate sample sizes based on research questions
- Choose suitable graphical displays for data presentation
- Account for potential biases in study design
- Consider both statistical and clinical significance
- Validate model fit in multivariable analyses
